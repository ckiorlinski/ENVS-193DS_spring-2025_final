# ENVS-193DS_spring-2025_final

Final for ENVS 193DS spring 2025. Course led by Prof. An Bui.

## General Information

This repository was created by Christopher Kiorlinski with the purpose of completing the final assignment examination for ENVS 193DS.
Using two data sets provided by the instructor, I created two visualizations from scratch that simulated two existing, professional level ggplot visualizations. One of these visualizations was created by the instructor, while the other is from this paper: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/rec.13319. Te]here were also sections testing our ability to pull information from incomplete data summaries, as well as a section to review our affective visualization based on feedback from Week 9 and 10's workshops.

## Data and File Information

There are two folders, a code and data folder. All code is in the code folder and all data sets are in the data folder.

The main folder with all the code is final.qmd.
